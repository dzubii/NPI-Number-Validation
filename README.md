# NPI-Number-Validation
This repo contains code that determines whether a given number is a valid NPI number.

A National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique 10-digit identification number issued to health care providers in the United States.

Given that an NPI number follows the algorithm defined https://www.eclaims.com/articles/how-to-calculate-the-npi-check-digit/, this program validates a given number.

This problem is solved without the use of a library.
